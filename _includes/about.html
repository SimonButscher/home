                <p>Since 2018 I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Human-computer Interaction Group of the University of Konstanz. My core research interests are human-computer interaction, usability research, reality-based interfaces, and information visualization. Beyond research, my field of activity ranges from the project lead of third-party projects to teaching activities and the supervision of student research projects. In addition, I have been working as a Freelancer in the field of Software/Database/Data Warehouse Engineering for over 12 years now.</p>
