            ... I am a computer scientist with a focus on user experience design and data science. During several years in academia and industry, 
            I have gained profound knowledge and experience in leading IT projects, business requirements analysis, user research, design thinking, 
            visual and interaction design, prototyping, software engineering, and qualitative and quantitative usability testing. I am further well 
            experienced in creating end-to-end analysis pipelines for large data sets using statistics, machine learning, and visual analytics.
            <br>
            Given my curious nature, I am constantly researching new designs, methods, and technologies which, first, provide the means to improve 
            business processes through information technology and second, can help to make the interaction with computing systems a better experience.
